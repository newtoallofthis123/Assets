            "First up, this is not like a super official book. It is a book I wrote in my free time or whenever I felt like not coding about stuff.\n\nThis book includes completely random and unfiltered observations that I random teenager made. These might now all be like the coolest and most awesome observations and thoughts, but I thought that it would be good if I could put these thoughts somewhere, in case I forget when I am 80 years old and eating cookies and someone is shouting at me to not eat cookies since they leave cookie crumbs.\n\nOne thing though, if you are like a serious reader and donâ€™t appreciate a little gen-z humor, read it still and leave me an angry review on twitter so that it boasts my engagement (thank you!)\n\nWith the same note though, most of this book will have a lot of gen-z slang. So, if you donâ€™t it, you might learn something new ðŸ™‚.\n\nIf you get offended by my humor Iâ€™m sorry.",
